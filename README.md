# nodejs-advanced-blog-app
i made a advanced blog app with nodejs. But i dont use jwt or advanced auth systems. Auth system is very simple so this app is not secure. And app doesnt have a PUT request so you can just post,delete,get requests.

This app so educational for me because i learned a lot of things in nodejs.

If you want to start app in your pc follow these steps:
1-npm install ejs, npm install express, npm install morgan, npm install mongoose
2- for start type node app in your shell

! Create your own mongoose database in mongodb atlas because im the only one who can access my mongoose cluster.
